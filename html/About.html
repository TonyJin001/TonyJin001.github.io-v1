              <h2>I'm Tony Yanfeng Jin</h2>
              <h5>Currently a first-year MS-HCI student at Georgia Tech</h5>

                <h4 class="quote">“I am a UX designer standing at the intersection of technology and people.”</h4>
                <br>
                <p>I received my bachelor’s degrees in <em>Computer Science and Psychology at Middlebury College</em>, a top liberal arts college in Vermont. My interdisciplinary background gives me a deep understanding of the power of information and computing, as well as the uniqueness and limitations of human beings.</p>
              </div>
              <br>
              <br>
              <div class="content-box">
                <h4 class="quote">“I leverage my technical and social science background to design systems that enable people to access the right information, when and where they need it.”</h4>
                <br>
                <p>My research experience at Carnegie Mellon University’s Ubicomp Lab made me realize how different technologies can potentially be used to improve people’s efficiency and mitigate frustrations during daily tasks. My technical background enables me to creatively incorporate cutting-edge technologies into my design, and my social science background enables me to accurately identify people’s pain points, and make decisions informed by evidence.</p>

              <div class="content-box">
                <h4 class="quote">“I am a writer and an orator.”</h4>
                <br>
                <p>My liberal arts education has helped me understand the importance of writing and expressing my ideas to different audiences in ways they can understand. I enjoy sharing my ideas through writing and speech, and I have worked as a writing and an oratory coach to help people write persuasively and let their voices heard. Currently, I am working at the Institute for Information Security & Privacy (IISP) at Georgia Tech to help publicize the importance of cybersecurity. I write new articles and redesign IISP’s website content to describe faculty and students’ cybersecurity research in ways that the general public can resonate with. I also aspire to form similar connections between technology and the general public as a UX designer.</p>

                <h4 class="quote">“My diverse experience has taught me the value of empathy.”</h4>
                <br>
                <p>I have lived, studied, and worked in China, the United States, and France. Wherever I live, I speak the local language, and work with local students and professionals. Naturally, I have learned to empathize with others, and to think from other people’s perspectives. This quality has proven to be valuable not only when I am working in teams, but also when I am interacting with users to identify what they need and I can help them as a UX designer. </p>
