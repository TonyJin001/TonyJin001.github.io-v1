                    We redesigned REI's website to provide more detailed guidance and support for novice backpackers to find the backpack of the right size, capacity, and features without having to travel to an REI store.

                  <h4>My Contribution</h4>
                  <p>During the initial research phase, I was in charge of contacting local REI stores for interview permission. After the first store declined our request, <strong>my perseverance helped us discover alternative choices, which led to more opportunities to interview customers/salespeople.</strong> I visited two different REI stores multiple times for observations and interviews, and conducted a task analysis based on the data collected. I also conducted several contextual inquiries, and was responsible for designing and distributing a detailed online survey that yielded <strong>hundreds of responses with rich qualitative data.</strong> I then analyzed the survey data and helped create affinity diagrams for interview/contextual inquiry data. I also created a customer journey map based on the data we gathered. <br><br>

                  Generated in the ideation phase, my ideas of providing guidance through an interactive survey and community-based expert support were both refined and incorporated into our final design. <br><br>

                  In addition, I contributed to the wireframe design and <strong>created two versions of interactive prototypes in InVision</strong> for two rounds of user testing. I synthesized users' feedback from both rounds, developed design implications, and <strong>created the final User Interface using Sketch.</strong> I also moderated several cognitive walkthrough and usability testing sessions.

              <div class="subgroup">
                <p>Through a series of primary research detailed below, including field observations, interviews and surveys, we decided to focus on <strong>novice backpacker's pack purchasing experience on REI's website.</strong></p>
              </div>

              <div id="field-visits" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Field Visits</h4>
                  <p>We first visited a local REI store several times to understand the general store layout, observe people's purchasing process, and identify the need we hope to address. <strong>We pivoted from focusing on tents to focusing on backpacks because there was generally a higher demand for help in the backpack area.</strong>  <br><br>
                  <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-observation-1.png" alt="Observations at REI"> <br>
                  I took the lead to come up with a scenario in which I needed to buy a multi-day backpacking pack for a 3-day trip in wilderness. <strong>I went through the entire backpack selection process in-store and interacted with salespeople with the objective dictated by the scenario in mind.</strong> The information gathered helped us create the task analysis for in-store backpack purchase. <br><br>
                  <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-observation-2.png" alt="Observations at REI"> <br>

                  During our visits, <strong>I also took the lead to talk with the store's manager for interview permissions.</strong> Though he had to decline our request, the manager pointed us to REI backpacking classes taught at another store, which graciously agreed to our interview request later.</p>

              <div id="task-analysis" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Task Analysis</h4>
                  <p>Based on the data we collected through field visits and exploration of REI's website/app, we created a task analysis for each context to better understand our users' pain points when purchasing a backpack through different channels. Here is a summary of the analysis: </p>

              <div id="interviews" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Interviews & Affinity Mapping</h4>
                <p>To better understand novice backpackers' current experience purchasing backpacks, we <strong>attended REI's lightweight backpacking class</strong>, and conducted <strong>short, semi-structured interviews with REI's customers and salespersons.</strong></p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-interviews.png" alt="Lightweight backpacking class & interview notes"><br><br>

                <p>
                We also interviewed <strong>a non-REI backpacking expert</strong> to learn about the best practices in the backpacking community that novice backpackers might not be aware of.</p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-affinity-1.png" alt="Lightweight backpacking class & interview notes"><br><br>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">
                We synthesized our results using affinity mapping and gained the following insights:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Fit</strong> is the most important factor to consider when purchasing a backpack; a backpack that fits poorly can cause discomfort and potentially injury.</li>
                  <li>Novice backpackers usually <strong>don't know what to consider</strong> when selecting a backpack.</li>
                  <li>Backpackers form a <strong>tight community</strong> and are usually willing to help each other.</li>
                  <li>There are a couple of questions that all REI salespersons are trained to ask in order to help their customers find the right backpack model.</li>
                  <li><strong>The in-store purchasing experience has few room for improvement,</strong> because almost all REI customers believe that REI's salespersons are well-trained and usually actively help them answer their questions. </li>
                  <li><strong>People are generally reluctant to make large purchases like buying backpacks on mobile apps.</strong> Such purchases require careful research beforehand, and people generally do not use mobile phones to conduct the research. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>As a result, <strong>we decided narrow down our focus to improving novice backpackers' pack purchasing experience on REI' website</strong>, since this context has the largest potential for improvement.</p>
              </div>

              <div id="survey" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Detailed Online Survey</h4>
                <p>After our decision to focus on REI's website, I designed and deployed a detailed survey on people's backpack purchasing experience on REI's website. Through the survey, we hope to learn more about the user demographics, what they look for when shopping for backpacks online, what their pain points are throughout the process, what they think REI's website is currently lacking, etc.</p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-survey.png" alt="Survey Results Example"><br><br>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Our main findings in the survey include: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Most users (around 70%) are between the age of 25 and 34.</li>
                  <li>Some users complete the entire process online, while others typically conduct online research first, before going in store to look and feel the physical products.</li>
                  <li>Users generally find REI's online expert advice articles to be <strong>inaccurate and outdated</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Users need <strong>more personalized advice from others in the backpacking community.</strong></li>
                </ul>
              <p>The survey, which received nearly 300 responses, also provided us with rich data for our persona creation, which is detailed below.</p>
              </div>


              <div id="summary-research" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Additional Research</h4>
                <p>In addition to interviews and surveys, our group also conducted <strong>contextual inquiries</strong>, <strong>online research of the user group (backpackers)</strong>, and <strong>analyses of frequently asked questions on REI's website</strong>. We analyzed our results using affinity mapping.
                </p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-affinity-2.jpg" alt="Affinity mapping"><br><br>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">We discovered that novice backpackers generally need help in the following areas:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Capacity: </strong>It is hard for novice backpackers to determine the capacity of their backpacks, which is highly dependent on what they bring and the length of their trips.</li>

                  <li><strong>Weight: </strong>Novice backpackers tend to <strong>overestimate</strong> how much they'll need for their trip. However, backpacking experts have repeatedly mentioned that one should always try to minimize the total weight of one's backpack.</li>

                  <li><strong>Fit: </strong>Without trying on the backpacks in store, it is extremely hard for novice backpackers to find a pack that fits well with their body. However, fit is <strong>the most important factor to consider</strong> when buying backs for multi-day backpacking treks. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">When they need help, novice backpackers usually resort to the following resources:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>REI Experts: </strong>Novice backpackers consistently report that in-store REI experts are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. However, the online expert advice provided by REI is perceived as static and outdated, which needs to be improved.</li>

                  <li><strong>Experience Backpackers from the Community: </strong>Our research shows that backpackers can be a very social, community-oriented group of people, who enjoy helping fellow backpackers, even strangers. Novice backpackers usually get advice from more experience backpackers they meet, either in person or on backpacking forums and Facebook groups.</li>
                </ul>

Each group member referred back to the user needs we identified in the research stage to make sure that the solutions we came up with addressed at least part of our users' needs. Below are some of our individual sketches.

                <h4>Design Alternatives</h4>
                <p>As a group, we merged our ideas into the following 3 design concepts:
                </p>
                <h5>Concept 1</h5>
                <p>In our first concept, we provide novice backpackers with <strong>a traditional survey</strong> which asks questions that would otherwised be asked by salespersons in REI's stores. After answering these questions, users will see a list of recommended backpacks that are suitable for their needs. They will also see a list of recommended features for them, and whether each recommended backpack has those features. <strong>This concept allows users to better understand and effectively find which backpacks will be the right fit for them, considering their size, weight, body frame and all of the items they will be carrying in their backpack.</strong></p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-concept-1.png" alt="Concept 1"> <br><br>

                <h5>Concept 2</h5>
                <p>Concept 2 provides users with <strong>an interactive video</strong> in which a qualified expert from REI talks about his backpacking experience. In the video, the expert will ask the same questions salespersons ask in an REI store, give tips to users on how to measure their bodies, and educate them what they should do to prepare for their specific trips. <strong>This concept could not only educate novice backpacker what they should consider while choosing a backpack, but also let them effectively locate the packs that best suit their needs.</strong></p>

                <p>Since research shows that backpackers usually form a close community, <strong>our third concept aims to bring the community together and let more experienced backpackers help novice backpackers with their purchase decisions.</strong> We provide an "Chat with Expert" function that enables users to email/chat with either REI salespersons or experienced backpackers online who have agreed to give advice to novice backpackers on REI's site. In the expert list, users are able to see the ratings of each expert, their specialties, and their experiences. <strong>This concept provides a platform for novice backpackers to reach out to experienced backpackers, learn from them, and find the right backpack more efficiently.</strong></p>

                <h4>User Feedback</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-bottom">In order to narrow down our ideas, we conducted 7 feedback sessions with novice backpackers to see their preferences. We found that:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Users generally prefer the survey tool (Concept 1) over the video tutorial (Concept 2)</strong>, because the survey enables them to skips parts and does not require audio output.</li>

                  <li>However, <strong>a number of users liked the personal elements of having the instructions narrated by Ned</strong> (an illustrative REI expert).</li>

                  <li>Users also reported that <strong>they will use the expert advice tool</strong>, and <strong>hopes to have access to it at any stage of the process.</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Based on the data, we made the following design decisions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Use the interactive survey</strong> as the main feature to help users narrow down their options.

                  <li><strong>Incorporate more personal features that users liked</strong> (e.g. narrating the text through the voice of Ned the expert) into the survey design.</li>

                  <li><strong>Create an expert advice tool</strong> to connect novice backpackers with REI salespersons as well as experts from the greater backpacking community.</li>

                  <li><strong>Allow users to access the expert advice tool anytime during the process</strong>.</li>

                <p><strong>To evaluate our prototype, we created the following task scenario for our users:</strong></p>

                <p style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">You are going to Smoky Mountain for a week-long backpacking trip and need to find a suitable backpack for the adventure. You will be travelling with your significant other, carrying a 2-person tent, a sleeping bag, but no sleeping mat or cooking gear. Please use the tool to narrow down your choices and seek advice from an expert to confirm the backpack capacity.</p>

                <p>During each evaluation session, we first showed users the current REI website, asked them several screening questions to make sure that they are novice backpackers, and explained to them the task scenario. After users completed the tasks, we asked them several follow up questions and encouraged them to provide feedback on the design.</p>

                <p>Based on users' feedback, I created the following <strong>design recommendations</strong> for our medium-fidelity prototype.</p>
