                    <p>Purchasing the right multi-day backpack can be a time-consuming and daunting experience for novice backpackers. A single mistake during the purchase might end up affecting the health and even safety of the backpacker during an extended trip in wilderness.<br><br>

                    We redesigned REI's website to provide more detailed guidance and support for novice backpackers to find the backpack of the right size, capacity, and features without having to travel to an REI store.

                  <h4>My Contribution</h4>
                  <p>During the initial research phase, I was in charge of contacting local REI stores for interview permission. After the first store declined our request, <strong>my perseverance helped us discover alternative choices, which led to more opportunities to interview customers/salespeople.</strong> I visited two different REI stores multiple times for observations and interviews, and conducted a task analysis based on the data collected. I also conducted several contextual inquiries, and was responsible for designing and distributing a detailed online survey that yielded <strong>hundreds of responses with rich qualitative data.</strong> I then analyzed the survey data and helped create affinity diagrams for interview/contextual inquiry data. I also created a customer journey map based on the data we gathered. <br><br>

                  Generated in the ideation phase, my ideas of providing guidance through an interactive survey and community-based expert support were both refined and incorporated into our final design. <br><br>

                  In addition, I contributed to the wireframe design and <strong>created two versions interactive prototypes in InVision</strong> for two rounds of user testing. I synthesized users' feedback from both rounds, developed design implications, and <strong>created the final User Interface using Sketch.</strong> I also moderated several cognitive walkthrough and usability testing sessions.

              <div class="subgroup">
                <p>Through a series of primary research detailed below, including field observations, interviews and surveys, we decided to focus on <strong>novice backpacker's pack purchasing experience on REI's website.</strong></p>
              </div>

              <div id="field-visits" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Field Visits</h4>
                  <p>We first visited a local REI store several times to understand the general store layout, observe people's purchasing process, and identify the need we hope to address. <strong>We pivoted from focusing on tents to focusing on backpacks because there was generally a higher demand for help in the backpack area.</strong>  <br><br>
                  <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-observation-1.png" alt="Observations at REI"> <br>
                  I took the lead to come up with a scenario in which I needed to buy a multi-day backpacking pack for a 3-day trip in wilderness. <strong>I went through the entire backpack selection process in-store and interacted with salespeople with the objective dictated by the scenario in mind.</strong> The information gathered helped us create the task analysis for in-store backpack purchase. <br><br>
                  <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-observation-2.png" alt="Observations at REI"> <br>

                  During our visits, <strong>I also took the lead to talk with the store's manager for interview permissions.</strong> Though he had to decline our request, the manager pointed us to REI backpacking classes taught at another store, which graciously agreed to our interview request later.</p>

              <div id="task-analysis" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Task Analysis</h4>
                  <p>Based on the data we collected through field visits and exploration of REI's website/app, we created a task analysis for each context to better understand our users' pain points when purchasing a backpack through different channels. Here is a summary of the analysis: </p>

              <div id="interviews" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Interviews & Affinity Mapping</h4>
                <p>To better understand novice backpackers' current experience purchasing backpacks, we <strong>attended REI's lightweight backpacking class</strong>, and conducted <strong>short, semi-structured interviews with REI's customers and salespersons.</strong></p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-interviews.png" alt="Lightweight backpacking class & interview notes"><br><br>

                <p>
                We also interviewed <strong>a non-REI backpacking expert</strong> to learn about the best practices in the backpacking community that novice backpackers might not be aware of.</p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-affinity-1.png" alt="Lightweight backpacking class & interview notes"><br><br>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">
                We synthesized our results using affinity mapping and gained the following insights:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Fit</strong> is the most important factor to consider when purchasing a backpack; a backpack that fits poorly can cause discomfort and potentially injury.</li>
                  <li>Novice backpackers usually <strong>don't know what to consider</strong> when selecting a backpack.</li>
                  <li>Backpackers form a <strong>tight community</strong> and are usually willing to help each other.</li>
                  <li>There are a couple of questions that all REI salespersons are trained to ask in order to help their customers find the right backpack model.</li>
                  <li><strong>The in-store purchasing experience has few room for improvement,</strong> because almost all REI customers believe that REI's salespersons are well-trained and usually actively help them answer their questions. </li>
                  <li><strong>People are generally reluctant to make large purchases like buying backpacks on mobile apps.</strong> Such purchases require careful research beforehand, and people generally do not use mobile phones to conduct the research. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>As a result, <strong>we decided narrow down our focus to improving novice backpackers' pack purchasing experience on REI' website</strong>, since this context has the largest potential for improvement.</p>
              </div>

              <div id="survey" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Detailed Online Survey</h4>
                <p>After our decision to focus on REI's website, I designed and deployed a detailed survey on people's backpack purchasing experience on REI's website. Through the survey, we hope to learn more about the user demographics, what they look for when shopping for backpacks online, what their pain points are throughout the process, what they think REI's website is currently lacking, etc.</p>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/REI-survey.png" alt="Survey Results Example"><br><br>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Our main findings in the survey include: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Most users (around 70%) are between the age of 25 and 34.</li>
                  <li>Some users complete the entire process online, while others typically conduct online research first, before going in store to look and feel the physical products.</li>
                  <li>Users generally find REI's online expert advice articles to be <strong>inaccurate and outdated</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Users need <strong>more personalized advice from others in the backpacking community.</strong></li>
                </ul>
              <p>The survey, which received nearly 300 responses, also provided us with rich data for our persona creation, which is detailed below.</p>

                <h4>Additional Research</h4>
                <p>In addition to interviews and surveys, our group also conducted <strong>contextual inquiries</strong>, <strong>online research of the user group (backpackers)</strong>, and <strong>analyses of frequently asked questions on REI's website</strong>. We analyzed our results using affinity mapping.
