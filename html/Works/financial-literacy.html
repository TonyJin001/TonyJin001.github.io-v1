                  <h4>My Contribution</h4>
                  <p>During the research phase, I conducted <strong>a literature review</strong> on personal finance education. In addition to contributing to the <strong>survey draft</strong> and the <strong>interview guide</strong>, I <strong>conducted semi-structured interviews</strong> with potential users and financial experts.

                  <br><br>During the ideation phase, <strong>my ideas of providing in-context feedback, visualizing one's future financial status and co-planning a major family spending were all modified and developed into our four final concepts</strong>. <br><br>

                  After that, I <strong>advocated for collecting user feedback</strong> on our four concepts, which helped us narrow our ideas down. I contributed to the <strong>information architecture design</strong>, and was responsible for <strong>creating the wireframes for the settings tab</strong>. I then created the <strong>user-flow</strong> of the app and an <strong>interactive prototype using InVision</strong>. <br><br>Finally, I moderated several <strong>usability testing</strong> sessions, and derived <strong>design implications from the data</strong> together with my teammates.

                  <p>We started the project having a vague idea that we hope to help young Americans learn more about personal finance. Initially, we hoped to help parents better educate their children about personal finance. <strong>However, we pivoted based on our primary and secondary research, and focused on helping emerging adults aged between 18 and 25 form better financial habits.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div id="lit-review" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Literature Review</h4>
                  <p>To understand the current problems young Americans are facing while learning about personal finance, we looked into the research literature. While most studies focused on evaluating the success of personal finance education curriculum in schools, data show that most young adults actually turn to their parents for advice when facing financial decision problems. <strong> The results motivated us to focus on parents in our following surveys and interviews to learn about their barriers when it comes to educating their children about personal finance.</strong> </p>
              </div>
              <div id="comp-analysis" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
                  <p>We also investigated the existing solutions used by parents who consider it significant to educate their children about financial literacy. We analyzed three products including an interactive website and two highly ranked education App from the iOS App Store/Google Play Store.
                  </p>
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="../../assets/walker-comp-analysis-1.png" alt="competitive analysis"> <br><br>
                  <p>
                  <strong>Pennybox</strong>: The app enables children to complete chores and collect money from parents into their Pennybox account. Children can then track how much they have saved, how much they have spent, and how much more they can earn. Children can also request a cash out, which parents can accept or decline. The tool is great for younger children to learn about what it means to earn money through working and save it; <strong>however, these concepts are too basic for teenagers who will soon need to manage a household and face real-world financial problems.</strong>
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>The Mint:</strong> The website provides learning materials for younger children, teenagers, parents and teachers on a variety of topics including earning, saving, owing, tracking, giving and investing. It provides quizzes and interactive games to teach basic financial concepts and gives children/teens some hands on practice in the virtual environment. <strong>However, the website is text-heavy and mostly non-interactive; the games only enable children/teens to practice basic activities like how to write a check, which are not interesting enough to keep them motivated.</strong></p>

                  <p>
                  <strong>PiggyBot:</strong> The app introduces children to the concept that managing money should have three parts: spending, sharing with others, and saving. It lets children set goals and take photos of those goals; it then shows them weekly how they are doing in terms of reaching their goals. This app permits parents to set up profiles for multiple children and keeps all the record-keeping in one place. <strong>However, like Pennybox, the app can be over-childish for teenagers and cannot be used to educate them about more complicated financial concepts.</strong>
                  </p>

                  <img class="img-responsive full-img" src="../../assets/logos.png" alt="logos"><br>
                  <p>Through competitive analysis, we discovered that most of the existing products are either interactive but simple, which work fine only with younger children, or informative but static, which can hardly draw children's or teenagers' interests. <strong>Few products target late adolescents, who are not yet motivated to learn about complicated financial concepts, but will soon need them as they start working or enter college. </strong>Therefore, we decided to narrow our user group down to late adolescents.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="surveys" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Surveys</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Because of our limited timeframe, we decided to deploy a survey as the first step of our primary research, because it is the fastest way to get a wide range of responses. Based on the findings from the literature review, we chose parents of teenage children as our participants. We hoped to understand what financial concepts parents hope their children learn before leaving home, whether they have attempted to educate their children about these concepts, and whether the process has been successful or not. <br><br>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img" src="../../assets/walker-survey.png" alt="Survey"> <br><br>

                Our main findings from the surveys are as follows: (observations here regarding "children" apply to teenage children and young adults)</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Budgeting</strong>, <strong>staying out of debt</strong>, and <strong>price vs. value</strong> (knowing the difference between the value and the price of something) are the top three concepts that parents want their children to learn before leaving home.</li>

                  <li>Managing one's own financial resources seems to be a <strong>distant topic</strong> for children before college.</li>

                  <li>Children usually <strong>lack interests</strong> in learning about financial knowledge.</li>

                  <li>Children in their early adolescence cannot understand certain personal finance knowledge.</li>

                  <li>Parents <strong>lack tools</strong> in educating their children about personal finance.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">These results lead us to design tools that will:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Motivate children to learn about concepts that parents believe are the most important: budgeting, staying out of debt, and price vs. value.</li>
                  <li>Bring distant financial concepts closer to children to stimulate their interests in personal finance.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div id="interviews" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Interviews & Affinity Mapping</h4>
                <p class="small-margin-bottom">We conducted several semi-structured interviews with parents and financial experts to dive deeper into the problems parents encounter when educating their children about personal finance and gain advice from experts.<br><br>

                We created an affinity map as a group to identify themes from our qualitative interview data. <br><br>

                  <img class="img-responsive full-img" src="../../assets/walker-affinity-all.jpg" alt="">

                <br><br>
                The main findings from the interviews are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Parents usually teach their children about personal finance through practical methods, like <strong>opening bank accounts for their children</strong> and <strong>letting them manage financial resources</strong>. These methods are considered effective. Some of the parents share financial knowledge during casual daily conversation too.</li>

                  <li>Lots of parents mentioned that <strong>there is not enough tools for them to teach their children about personal finance</strong>.</li>

                  <li>Some parents consider themselves <strong>inadequate in financial literacy</strong> and thus cannot really educate their children effectively.</li>
                </ul>

                <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/walker-interview-notes.png" alt="interview notes"> <br><br>
                <p class="small-margin-bottom">In addition, our interviews with financial experts gave us some new insights that we were not aware of before:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Not only teenagers, <strong>but also adults in their early 20s</strong> do not typically know how to manage their own financial resources.</li>

                  <li>Making a detailed budget plan and sticking to it (similar to a diet plan) is essential. However, most people, even adults, <strong>only have a vague idea about their financial own status</strong>.</li>

                  <li>It is important to make distant financial concepts concrete for children in order for them to know their importance.</li>

                  <li>Pre-college teenagers usually do not understand the importance of financial literacy when they are around their parents; once they enter college and start facing real-world financial decisions, they realize the importance of learning personal finance knowledge, but they no longer have enough chance/motivation to ask their parents about the topic.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Based on the survey & interview results, we realized that <strong>both pre-college teenagers and emerging adults aged between 18 and 25 have the need to learn to better manage their financial resources.</strong> Since we cannot narrow down our user group based on our evidence, instead of arbitrarily deciding on a group to focus on, we delineated the different needs for pre-college teenagers and emerging adults, and brainstormed ideas for both.</p>

                  Based on the evidence we collected from user research, we conducted an <strong>informed brainstorming session</strong>. Each member first came up with a variety of ideas individually. The group then convened for several hours to share all the ideas and form a number of new ideas.<br><br>

                  We followed a roundtable “yes and” collaborative ideation process, in which we added on each other’s ideas to push them further for more details. We also had a session in which we voiced potential difficulties for the ideas on the list so that we can either further develop them and produce possible solutions, or eliminate them because of their low feasibility. <br><br>

                  We then narrowed down our ideas by grouping similar ones into bigger themes. <strong>We also referred back to the main findings in our user research, to make sure that all the themes we identified can address at least one of the main concerns of our users.</strong> Eventually, we narrowed our ideas down to the following four large themes that address our users’ concerns from different perspectives utilizing different methods. <strong>The first two concepts primarily address the need of emerging adults aged between 18 and 25, while the last two concepts target parents and their pre-college children.</strong>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Our first concept leverages push notifications to encourage users (emerging adults) to provide feedback to themselves over time. With the user's own input, the system can generate personalized financial advice for the user.</p>

                <h5>Concept 2</h5>
                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Concept 2 enables users (emerging adults) to set long-term financial goals, and clearly visualize how their current saving/spending behaviors can influence these goals. It brings distant financial concepts closer to users and provides actionable suggestions on what users can do now to achieve their goals in the future.</p>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Concept 4 aims at giving children a sense of agency by giving them a portion of the family's budget and letting them make spending decisions under the guidance of their parents. Parents will provide rewards depending on how well their children spend the money. </p>

                <h4>User Feedback & Design Implications</h4>
                <p>Of the 15 users we interviewed, most people preferred Concept 1 and Concept 2, which target emerging adults. For Concept 3 and Concept 4, participants believed that parents might not want to follow the instructions in the tool, and might want to carry out our supported tasks outside of our tool.Though the aim of these concepts is to provide a much-needed platform for parents to start conversations on personal finance with their children, most users cannot see it happening. <strong>Therefore, we decided to narrow our choices down to Concept 1 and Concept 2, and target emerging adults only.</strong></p>

                <p>Several participants also pointed out that visualizing one's future financial conditions based on current saving/spending behaviors might not make sense for emerging adults. People between 18 and 25 are generally in the process of choosing a field of study or exploring career opportunities; it's usually unclear to them how their financial conditions might change depending on their careers changes.<strong>As a result, Concept 2 might not seem appealing to emermging adults.</strong></p>

                <p>However, participants did mention that having a short-term financial status analysis feature (with no long-term goal setting) is beneficial. Therefore, we decided to combine that feature from Concept 2 with Concept 1 in our final design. We also derived the following <strong>design implications</strong> from participants' feedback on Concept 1 and Concept 2. Here are some examples:</p>
