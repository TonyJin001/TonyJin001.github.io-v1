                  <h4>Methods</h4>
                  <p>The degree to which the misinformation effect occurs is a result of the alteration of specific variables during different stages of the misinformation paradigm. In order to determine the variables that influence the misinformation effect, researchers have been able to reliably induce false memories within individuals in laboratory settings through suggestion, framing of questions, and exposure to other witnesses (Shaw & Porter, 2015; Coxon & Valentine, 1997; Gabbert, Memon, & Allan, 2003). A misinformation paradigm study by Belli et al. (1992) tested 228 subjects on their recollection of an initial event and manipulated the duration between the misinformation-encoding phase and the recall phase. This experiment demonstrated that the degree in which the misinformation effect occurred was much higher in the longer retention condition (5-7 days) than the shorter retention condition (15 minutes). Additionally, repeated exposure to misinformation during the recall phase increases the probability that the misinformation effect occurs (Roediger III et al., 1996). An individual’s perception of source credibility, whether the subject perceives a source providing information as credible, has been shown to greatly influence the degree at which the misinformation effect occurs (Dodd & Bradshaw, 1980).

                  <h4>My Role</h4>
                  <p>The misinformation encoding phase has been manipulated in multiple studies in order to test which variables have a greater impact on the degree to which the misinformation effect occurs. For example, the credibility of the source that provides misinformation plays an important role in whether the misinformation is incorporated into one’s memory. People are more likely to accept misinformation when it is shared by a credible source instead of a non-credible source (Echterhoff, Hirst, & Hussy, 2005), such that the likelihood an individual will recall false details about an event is higher when individuals are exposed to misinformation from high credibility sources than misinformation from low credibility sources (Dodd & Bradshaw, 1980).
                  There are multiple factors that determine whether sources are deemed credible or not-credible. People who receive misinformation from sources thought to be experts in the field are more likely to incorporate this false information into their memory than those who receive misinformation from a naive source (Smith & Ellsworth, 1987). In addition, figures of authority, such as those with respectable professions, are considered to be of high credibility (Wathen & Burkell, 2002). Source credibility is also influenced by the perceived social role the source is thought to play. As cited by Dodd & Bradshaw (1980), in a study by Hovland et al. (1953) subjects who were initially shown slides of a car accident and then received misinformation from a lawyer of the driver who caused the crash were less inclined to believe these details; therefore, the social context that explains why a certain source is providing information is important to the perception of credibility. Forming perceptions about a source’s credibility often occurs quickly and subconsciously. The deliberate attention to a source may decrease the degree to which the misinformation effect occurs.

              <h3>Methods</h3>
              <div id="methods-1" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Participants</h4>
                  <p>Students were recruited from Middlebury College (n=47). Participants were between the ages of 18 and 22. All of the participants were students from Introduction to Psychology at Middlebury College who received course credit for their involvement. Participants were under the impression that they signed up for a study on their Perceptions of Driving and were told that the purpose of this study was to examine the correlations between personal driving experience and awareness of dangerous road behavior.</p>

              <div id="methods-2" class="subgroup">
                  <h4>Design</h4>
                  <p>As seen in Table 1, all participants were randomly assigned into one of four groups: high-high credibility (n=12), high-low credibility (n=11), low-high credibility (n=10), and low-low credibility (n=14). The first source always provides misinformation, while the second source always provides correct information. High credibility sources were either the official, verified Facebook accounts of the California Highway Patrol or the California Police Department. Low credibility sources were the Facebook accounts of random social media users – Dre Erwin or Edward Holmes. Within each credibility group, participants were also randomly divided into one of two subgroups that were categorized based on which set of details the posts contained. Subgroup A’s posts contained five details including the time in which the car accident occurred and the color of the car that instigated the crash. Subgroup B’s posts contained details including the lane the car causing the accident turned from and whether the cars had on their emergency flashers.

              <div id="methods-3" class="subgroup">
                <h4>Materials</h4>
                <p>Video of Initial Event: Participants watched a 1:14 minute video of a car accident that happened on a major California highway. The video was captured by the dashboard camera of a truck that happened to record the crash.<br>
                <strong>Facebook Posts:</strong> Facebook accounts were taken and photoshopped to display different narratives pertaining to the car accident participants witnessed in the initial encoding phase. Participants were always shown two narratives, one with misinformation and one without. A narrative with misinformation is available in the appendix under figure 4, and a narrative with correct information is available under figure 5.<br>
                <strong>Memory Test:</strong> All participants were given the same questionnaire in order to test their recollection of the video of the car crash they previously watched. The questionnaire was composed of 18 True & False questions. The questions concerned 10 general details about the accident. For 8 out of the 10 details, we asked participants two True & False questions, one of them containing a correct statement, the other containing a statement that included the misinformation detail mentioned in the Facebook narratives with misinformation in them. For example, for the two questions concerning the color of the car that caused the accident, one stated that the car was green (True), and the other stated that the car was black (False; black was mentioned as a piece of misinformation in the Facebook post). We asked only one True & False question for each of the other 2 False details, making the total number of questions 18. Of these 18 questions, 9 questions were directly related to the details from the first version of posts (Subgroup A), and the other 9 questions were directly related to the details from the second version of posts (Subgroup B). Thus, for each subgroup, one set of 9 questions served as control items because the details mentioned in those questions only occurred in the initial video stimulus and were not mentioned again during the misinformation phase.
