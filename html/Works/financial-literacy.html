                  <p>During the research phase, I conducted <strong>a literature review</strong> on personal finance education and <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> with potential users and financial experts.

                  <br><br>During the ideation phase, <strong>three of my ideas were modified and developed into our four final concepts</strong>. I then <strong>advocated for collecting user feedback</strong>, which helped us narrow our ideas down. I contributed to the <strong>information architecture design</strong>, and was responsible for <strong>creating the wireframes for the settings tab</strong>. I then created the <strong>user-flow</strong> of the app and an <strong>interactive prototype using InVision</strong>. <br><br>Finally, I moderated several <strong>usability testing</strong> sessions, and <strong>led the discussion of deriving design implications from the data</strong> with my teammates.

                  <p>We started the project having a vague idea that we hope to help young Americans learn more about personal finance. Initially, we hoped to help parents better educate their children about personal finance. <strong>However, we pivoted based on our primary and secondary research, and focused on helping emerging adults aged between 18 and 25 form better financial habits.</strong></p>

                  <p>While most studies in the literature focused on evaluating the success of personal finance education curriculum in schools, data show that most young adults actually turn to their parents for advice when facing financial decision problems. <strong> The results motivated us to focus on parents in our following surveys and interviews to learn about their barriers when it comes to educating their children about personal finance.</strong> </p>

                  <img class="img-responsive" src="../../assets/walker-comp-analysis-all.png" alt="competitive analysis"> <br><br><br>

                  <p class="small-margin-bottom">We found that: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Existing personal finance education apps</strong> are either <strong>too childish for teenagers</strong> or <strong>too static to raise teenagers' interests</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal finance management apps</strong> focus on <strong>budgeting instead of spending wisely</strong>.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Few products target late adolescents</strong>, who are not yet motivated to learn about complicated financial concepts, but will soon need them as they start working or enter college. <strong>Therefore, we decided to narrow our user group down to late adolescents</strong>.</p>

                    <strong>Pennybox</strong>: The app enables children to complete chores and collect money from parents into their Pennybox account. Children can then track how much they have saved, spent, and how much more they can earn. Children can also request a cash out. The tool is great for younger children to learn about what it means to earn and save money through working; <strong>however, these concepts are too basic for teenagers who will soon need to manage a household and face real-world financial problems.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Mint:</strong> The website provides learning materials for younger children, teenagers, parents and teachers on a variety of topics including earning, saving, owing, and investing. It provides quizzes and interactive games to teach basic financial concepts and gives children/teens hands-on practice in the virtual environment. <strong>However, the website is text-heavy and mostly non-interactive; the games only enable children/teens to practice basic activities like how to write a check, which are not interesting enough to keep them motivated.</strong></p>

                    <p>
                    <strong>PiggyBot:</strong> The app introduces children to the concept that managing money should have three parts: spending, sharing with others, and saving. It lets children set goals and take photos of those goals; it then shows them weekly how they are doing in terms of reaching their goals. This app permits parents to set up profiles for multiple children and keep all the records in one place. <strong>However, like Pennybox, the app can be over-childish for teenagers and cannot be used to educate them about more complicated financial concepts.</strong>

                <h4>Surveys</h4>
                <p>Because of our limited timeframe, we decided to deploy a survey as the first step of our primary research, because it is the fastest way to get a wide range of responses. <strong>Based on the findings from the literature review, we chose parents of teenage children as our participants</strong>. We hoped to understand what financial concepts parents hope their children learn before leaving home, whether they have attempted to educate their children about these concepts, and whether the process has been successful.</p>

                <div class="collapse" id="survey-details">
                  <p>Our main findings from the surveys are as follows: (observations here regarding "children" apply to teenage children and young adults)</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Budgeting</strong>, <strong>staying out of debt</strong>, and <strong>price vs. value</strong> (knowing the difference between the value and the price of something) are the top three concepts that parents want their children to learn before leaving home.</li>

                    <li>Managing one's own financial resources seems to be a <strong>distant topic</strong> for children before college.</li>

                    <li>Children usually <strong>lack interests</strong> in learning about financial knowledge.</li>

                    <li>Children in their early adolescence cannot understand certain personal finance knowledge.</li>

                    <li>Parents <strong>lack tools</strong> in educating their children about personal finance.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="small-margin-bottom">These results lead us to design tools that will:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Motivate children to learn about concepts that parents believe are the most important</strong>: budgeting, staying out of debt, and price vs. value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bring distant financial concepts closer to children</strong> to stimulate their interests in personal finance.</li>

                <p>We conducted several semi-structured interviews with <strong>parents</strong> and <strong>financial experts</strong> to dive deeper into the problems parents encounter when educating their children about personal finance and gain advice from experts.<br><br>

                We created an affinity map as a group to identify themes from our qualitative interview data.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Parents usually teach their children about personal finance through practical methods, like <strong>opening bank accounts for their children</strong> and <strong>letting them manage financial resources</strong>. These methods are considered effective. Some of the parents share financial knowledge during casual daily conversation too.</li>

                    <li>Lots of parents mentioned that <strong>there is not enough tools for them to teach their children about personal finance</strong>.</li>

                    <li>Some parents consider themselves <strong>inadequate in financial literacy</strong> and thus cannot really educate their children effectively.</li>

                  <p class="small-margin-bottom">In addition, our interviews with financial experts gave us some <strong>new insights</strong> that we were not aware of before:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Not only teenagers, <strong>but also adults in their early 20s</strong> do not typically know how to manage their own financial resources.</li>

                    <li>Making a detailed budget plan and sticking to it (similar to a diet plan) is essential. <strong>However, most people, even adults, only have a vague idea about their financial own status</strong>.</li>

                    <li>It is important to <strong>make distant financial concepts concrete</strong> for children in order for them to know their importance.</li>

                    <li>Pre-college teenagers usually do not understand the importance of financial literacy when they are around their parents; once they enter college and start facing real-world financial decisions, they realize the importance of learning personal finance knowledge, but they no longer have enough chance/motivation to ask their parents about the topic.</li>

                    We followed a roundtable “yes and” collaborative ideation process, in which we added on each other’s ideas to push them further for more details. We also voiced potential difficulties for the ideas on the list so that we can either further develop them and produce possible solutions, or eliminate them because of their low feasibility. <br><br>

                    We then narrowed down our ideas by grouping similar ones into bigger themes. <strong>We also referred back to the main findings in our user research, to make sure that all the themes we identified can address at least one of the main concerns of our users.</strong>
                  </p>
                </div>
                <p>Eventually, we narrowed our ideas down to the following four large themes that address our users’ concerns from different perspectives. <strong>The first two concepts primarily address the need of emerging adults aged between 18 and 25, while the last two concepts target parents and their pre-college children.</strong></p>

                <p>After that, we created a usage scenario for each concept, and drew out wireframes for crucial screens that represent the essence of our ideas. <strong>We then showed the following concepts and scenarios to potential users, and asked them about their preferences and their feedback on our designs.</strong>
                </p>
                <h5>Concept 1</h5>
                <p class="small-margin-bottom">Our first concept leverages push notifications to encourage users (emerging adults) to provide feedback to themselves over time. With the user's own input, the system can generate personalized financial advice for the user.</p>

                <p class="small-margin-bottom">After gathering feedback from 15 users, <strong>we decided to proceed with Concept 1 as our core concept, and incorporate the short-term financial status analysis feature from Concept 2 into our final design</strong>.</p><br>

                <div class="collapse" id="concept-feedback-details">
                  <p>Most users preferred Concept 1 and Concept 2, which target emerging adults. For Concept 3 and Concept 4, participants believed that parents might not want to follow the instructions in the tool, and might want to carry out our supported tasks outside of our tool. Though the aim of these concepts is to provide a much-needed platform for parents to start conversations on personal finance with their children, most users cannot see it happening. <strong>Therefore, we decided to narrow our choices down to Concept 1 and Concept 2, and target emerging adults only.</strong></p>

                  <p>Several participants also pointed out that <strong>visualizing one's future financial conditions based on current saving/spending behaviors might not make sense for emerging adults</strong>. People between 18 and 25 are generally in the process of choosing a field of study or exploring career opportunities; it's usually unclear to them how their financial conditions might change depending on their careers changes. <strong>As a result, Concept 2 might not seem appealing to emerging adults.</strong> However, participants did mention that having a short-term financial status analysis feature (with no long-term goal setting) is beneficial. Therefore, we incorporated the short-term financial status analysis feature into our final design.</p>
                </div>

                <p>We also derived several <strong>design implications</strong> from participants' feedback on Concept 1 and Concept 2. Here are some examples:</p>

                <div class="collapse" id="usability-details">
                  <p>To evaluate the usability of the system, we developed the following 4 tasks that cover all the main features we have in our application.</p>

                  <img class="img-responsive full-img"src="../../assets/walker-tasks.png" alt="Tasks"><br><br>

                  <p>After providing a high-level description of our application's core functionalities and letting users freely explore it for 2 minutes, <strong>we let users accomplish the 4 tasks one at a time while thinking aloud</strong>. We then let our users fill out a questionnaire asking their demographic information, their purchasing habits, and their subjective ratings of the usability of the app (adapted from the System Usability Scale, or SUS).<br><br>

                  To measure the <strong>learnability</strong> of our app, we let our users accomplish the 4 tasks again after they fill out the questionnaire. Since the problem we are tackling through our design is complex, and our app inevitably introduces new concepts to our users, <strong>we don't expect our users to understand them immediately</strong>. <strong>However, we believe that our users should easily understand the core functionalities of our app after their first use</strong>. Therefore, we asked users to compare their experiences completing the tasks in the two rounds of testing.<br><br>

                  Finally, we asked our users some general questions about their favorite and least favorite parts of the design, whether they understand the new concepts we brought in, etc.<br><br>
                 </p>
                </div>

                <p>Users' subjective rating of the app indicated that even though the system is inherently complex, <strong>it is highly usable and learnable</strong>.<br><br>

                For issues raised by multiple users, <strong>we derived the following design directions</strong>, grouped by tab.</p>
